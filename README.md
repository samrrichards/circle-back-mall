## Circle Back Mall

This is a genericized version of a simulation I built on contract for a machine learning company, which displays entrances and exists detected at a shopping mall over the course of a Saturday in 2018. I've updated the code to make it more in-line with contemporary React best-practices (including the hooks API, which hadn't been released yet when I built the simulation).
